"My FB account was hacked and I have been trying to reclaim it for the past 6 months. I was able to change my password back but was still locked out. All I needed to do was contact support. Only to realize this rich ass company doesn’t have a customer support team and it’s all automated. The issue was that whoever hacked my account changed the 2FA to their phone number. So even though I sent proof of ownership by showing my ID and explicitly saying I need to bypass the 2FA just this once, I keep getting the automated response of “yeah that makes, we can get your account back to you, we just gotta send you a code to your 2FA and you’ll be all set :)”

"In these cases, Sweeney uses data from the ADS-B transponders present on most aircraft which show a plane’s location in the air in real time as charted on the ADS-B Exchange. And though Sweeney’s bots can’t pull from blocked FAA data to figure out where a plane plans to go, they can cross-reference the real-time ADS-B data with another website that posts anonymized versions of the FAA flight plans. This allows the bot to match the plane it is tracking in real time to the anonymized FAA flight plans and determine each plane’s intended destination.

It’s a loophole in high-profile security that has only flown under the radar because one needs a lot of industry-specific knowledge to know all this data was available and public, and to understand how to parse it.

">Every year, humans cut down about 15 billion trees. This massive deforestation is the root cause of many climate change-driven problems our world is facing at the moment. If it turns out to be successful, lab-grown wood can help us get rid of deforestation once and all. Let’s hope, this becomes a reality soon.

Well ... the issue with us cutting down trees is NOT the fact that we cut them down for the wood, it's that we cut them down for the land. In brazil they clear massive amounts of forest for making plantations. There's no regrowth in that at all. In Finland and Sweden (probably most of Europe / EU) we cut down forest mostly for the wood and then we re-plant the forest... and on top of that we're switching the way we do the cutting of the forest to a way where we don't do as much clear cutting anymore. 

I see this advancement as a fun project, but I don't see it as a solution to the actual problem we're facing, which is clearcutting for the sake of the land.",neutral

"From the article: The Ukrainian Security Service (SSU) has announced that since the start of the war with Russia, it has discovered and shut down five bot farms with over 100,000 fake social media accounts spreading fake news.

The network, which operated in Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Ternopil, and Zakarpattia, aimed to discourage Ukrainian citizens and instill panic by distributing false information about the Russian invasion and the status of the defenders.

According to the SSU’s announcement, the goal of the network was to destabilize the sociopolitical situation in various regions, thus curbing the resistance of the Ukrainian militia.

The law enforcement agency in Ukraine raided the locations that hosted the bot farms and seized the following items:

100 sets of GSM gateways, 10,000 SIM cards for various mobile operators to disguise the fraudulent activity, Laptops and computers used for controlling and coordinating the bots",fear

"From the complaint:

> in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors.

Basically Google would pay companies to make their search engine the default (eg. Mozilla for firefox). Just paying is probably fine, but requiring that a counterparty not strike deals with Google's competitors is crossing a line (using their market dominance unfairly). 

Apparently these sort deals with exclusionary parts cover 60% of all searches. Combine the size of those deals with google's own tech (google.com, chrome, etc) and google has roughly 80% of all search. Which is probably large enough to trigger the rules against using market dominance unfairly.

This point is very telling:

> Google’s practices are anticompetitive under long-established antitrust law. Almost 20 years ago, the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Microsoft recognized that anticompetitive agreements by a high-tech monopolist shutting off effective distribution channels for rivals, such as by requiring preset default status (**as Google does**) and making software undeletable (**as Google also does**), were exclusionary and unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

According to CNBC, the SEC’s fines for this kind of violation typically aren’t exorbitant (for the world’s richest man at least), and tend to waver around the $100,000 mark.

Another issue could relate to the way he announced the stock purchase, with a Schedule 13G filing instead of selecting the more complicated 13D. The difference is that anyone acquiring more than 5 percent of a company’s shares is required to register it, and according to Investopedia, the 13D form includes asking about plans “involving a merger, reorganization, or liquidation of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries.” The simpler 13G form does not ask those questions, however. It’s intended for use when investors “have no intention of influencing control of the issuer,” and taking a board seat suggests that isn’t the case.

“Over the course of two years, Puri created ElSa (short for elephant savior), a low-cost prototype of a machine-learning-driven software that analyzes movement patterns in thermal infrared videos of humans and elephants. Puri says the software is four times more accurate than existing state-of-the-art detection methods. It also eliminates the need for expensive high-resolution thermal cameras, which can cost in the thousands, she says. ElSa uses a $250 FLIR ONE Pro thermal camera with 206x156 pixel resolution that plugs into an off-the-shelf iPhone 6.

That being said I think there will always be a market for things made by a human - if only for the fact that they were made by a human.

You can put in a prompt and get amazing art - but trying to get what you’re imagining in your head is still really hard to do. For me the most useful thing has been to generate inspiration - ideas for color palettes, compositions I wouldn’t have thought of and so on. I could also see this tech enabling artists to create works that previously would have been impossible to do on your own.
